# Sustainable Crop Recommendation AI
This project was developed for the Foundation Course at Atmiya University.

## Problem Statement
Traditional farming leads to resource waste. This AI model recommends the best crop based on soil nutrients (N, P, K) and climate data to promote sustainable agriculture.

## Technology Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Random Forest Classifier (Accuracy: 99%)
